# The Battle of Neighborhoods: Business Location Analysis

![Project Banner](https://github.com/yawdap/The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-Coursera-Capstone-Project/blob/master/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate.png)  

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and compares neighborhoods in major cities to determine optimal locations for new businesses (e.g., restaurants, retail stores). Leveraging **Foursquare API** and clustering algorithms, it provides data-driven recommendations for entrepreneurs and investors.

**Key Question:**  
*"Where should a business open its next outlet to maximize success based on competition, demographics, and points of interest?"*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Data Sources:** Foursquare API, Geospatial Data (Geopy)
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Folium, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** K-Means Clustering, Scikit-learn
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Extract venue data using Foursquare API
   - Gather demographic/geospatial data (e.g., population density)

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Calculate proximity scores to competitors
   - Create density metrics for venue categories

3. **Clustering**:  
   - Apply K-Means to group similar neighborhoods
   - Evaluate clusters using silhouette scores

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Interactive Folium maps showing optimal zones
   - Comparative charts of key metrics

## 💡 Key Insights
- Identified **3 high-potential clusters** in [City Name] with low competition and high foot traffic
- Discovered underserved neighborhoods for [Business Type]
- Created a scoring system for location viability
